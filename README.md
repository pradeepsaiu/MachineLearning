# MachineLearning Examples with MATLAB
This Repository consists of MATLAB implementation of basic Machine Learning Examples.

## 1. ML-bias_variance/ex5
Explains Graphically how to adjust data based on bias vs variance, which parameters to alter in 
different situations.

## 2. ML-linear_regression/ex1
A linear regression model to predict admissions of students into a college.

## 3. ML-logistic_regression/ex2	
This Folder contains a binary classifier with logistic regression uses a sigmoid function for hypothesis.


## 4. ML-neural_backpropogation/ex4
This project implements the weight learning techqnique to learn weights inside neural network
using back propogation

## 5. ML-neural_onevsall_logistic	
This project is an one vs all classifier based on neural network with logistic regression technique.
